# Module 2 Lab Exercise â€“ Add a Local Data Input 

## Objective:
By the end of the session, you will be able to:
- Objetive 1 - In this lab exercise, you will create all the local indexes on the deployment/test server required for the subsequent lab exercises. In later lab exercises, you will forward data inputs to remote indexers. This requires that your deployment/test server have the same local indexes as the remote indexers. Finally, you will create a local file input (monitor) to be indexed on your deployment/test server.

## Time for this activity:
- 30 minutes.

## Help Table:
Add a table with the information that participants may need during the lab, such as software version, server IPs, usernames, and access credentials.
