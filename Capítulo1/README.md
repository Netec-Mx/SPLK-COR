# Module 1 Lab Exercise – Explore your Splunk Lab Environment

## Objective:
By the end of the session, you will be able to:
- Objetive 1 - Welcome to your lab environment. In this exercise, you will perform basic configuration tasks using the Splunk Web interface and, using the CLI, investigate Splunk system settings.
Please ensure you are able to identify all of the following values that have been provided to you.
Your student ID is a unique digit identifier used throughout the lab exercises to uniquely identify your work from other class participants’ work. Substitute the “#” references in this lab document with your student ID, when asked to.
Student ID: {student-ID}

- Objetive 2 - Search Head Credentials
This lab environment uses a shared search head. Log into the search head using your unique assigned Splunk username. The Splunk power role has been assigned to your account. You will never log into the search head as admin.
Search Head Splunk Web URL: http://	  {SH-ip}   :8000                            
Splunk username: {user-ID}	Password: {password}

- Objetive 3 - Deployment Server/Test Server Credentials
You have been assigned your own deployment server/test server Splunk instance. The command line access procedure depends upon the underlying operating system (Linux or Windows). Splunk Web (browser) access procedures are the same regardless of the underlying operating system.
Deployment Server/Test Server Splunk Web URL: http://	:8000 {DS-ip}
Splunk username: admin	Password:	{password}
Linux OS
To access the Linux operating system, you will use an SSH client such as Mac Terminal or PuTTY (Windows).
Linux host IP address name: {DS-ip}
Linux Username: {os-user}	Password: {password}
Windows OS
To access the Windows operating system, you will use a Remote Desktop client (RDC), such as Microsoft Remote Desktop.
Windows host IP address name: {DS-ip}
RDC Username: student# Password:
