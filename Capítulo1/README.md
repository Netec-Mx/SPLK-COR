# Module 1 Lab Exercise – Explore your Splunk Lab Environment

## Objective:
By the end of the session, you will be able to:
- Objetive 1 - Welcome to your lab environment. In this exercise, you will perform basic configuration tasks using the Splunk Web interface and, using the CLI, investigate Splunk system settings.
Please ensure you are able to identify all of the following values that have been provided to you.
Your student ID is a unique digit identifier used throughout the lab exercises to uniquely identify your work from other class participants’ work. Substitute the “#” references in this lab document with your student ID, when asked to.
Student ID: {student-ID}

- Objetive 2 - Search Head Credentials
This lab environment uses a shared search head. Log into the search head using your unique assigned Splunk username. The Splunk power role has been assigned to your account. You will never log into the search head as admin.
